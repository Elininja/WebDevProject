#My Ticker Web App
Creating order out of chaos in the classroom.

#What's currently happening
+Not pushed to Heroku yet. You'll need to run the app locally with Shotgun.
+Currently just a skeleton, next I plan to add:
  -Form to specify a name to attach to each number
  -Button to clear the current number and move on to the next

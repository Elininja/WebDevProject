#My Ticker Web App
**Creating order out of chaos in the classroom.**

##What's currently happening
Right now the app is just a skeleton, next I plan to add a form to specify a name to attach to each number, as well as a button to clear the current number  and move on to the next one

Not pushed to Heroku yet. You'll need to run the app locally with Shotgun.
